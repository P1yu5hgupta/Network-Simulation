# Network-Simulator
 Simulation of wired as well as wireless network functions and protocols (e.g., routing algorithms, TCP, UDP) using Network Simulator 2.


Wired Network:

We have used 6 nodes in wired networks and tried do simulate the 
packet transfer between the nodes using AODV (Adhoc On-Demand 
distance vector) protocol. As in wired node0 is treated as a source 
and node3 as a destination under UDP connection with CBR and 
node2 is treated as a source and node5 as a destination under TCP 
connection with FTP.


Wireless Network:
In wireless network we have to create node configuration and node movement is programmed. At what time which node should move with what speed and destination of the node and all.
